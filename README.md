# Subtraction_in_2s_complement
TO SUBTRACT 2 NUMBERS IN BINARY AND TO REPRESENT THAT NUMBER IN 2'S COMPLEMENT(SIMULATED IN PROTEUS)

This circuit can be used for a max 16 bit number.

# Algo behind this

![algo 2's complement subtraction](https://github.com/9389lalit/Subtraction_in_2s_complement/assets/99964550/fc844ea5-ec6f-43c2-9dbd-dfeb44c888a9)

So we are using some not gates some xor gates and 2 4 bit paraller adder for the implementation of a 4 bit number
So for a 16 bit number we will use 4 units of this circuit.

# Circuit of the 2's complement subtraction
After the whole implementation the circuit whole looks as in the image.

Due to some module issues i have used the xnor gate + not gate instead of xor gate in my circuit.

# Display the output
To display the output we are using the 7 Segment Display here.

To use the project just download it and run on proteus 8.13 and above.
